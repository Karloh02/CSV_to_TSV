The program was made to automate a task in wich we receive a CSV file with data from emission tests, and transforms it to a TSV file, this file needs to be manipulated in a way that the software INCA can reconize the file and read all the data. 

The app uses some user inputs, such as the location of the CSV file, where the user wants to save the file, the language in wich the user PC is in. 

The language is used, because during testing we have found that INCA uses "," as a decimal separator for portuguese windows language, and uses "." for english windows language. 

The program works fine and relative fast, if compared to the previous method used in the company. 

There are points for improvement, however, computer science is not my main goal, and I only do things to autoamte some repetitive work in the places I work, so if you find some improvements that can be done, or with you any questions, please feel free to reach me out at: gabrielraka@hotmail.com
